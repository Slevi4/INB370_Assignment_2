INB370 Assignment 2
Shannon Levick (n8591431) - slevi4@gmail.com
Yujin Oh (n8560170)

Declarations:
I, Shannon Levick (n8591431), completed all the work in the asgn2Vehicles, asgn2Tests and asgn2CarParks packages.
This includes all the overall structure, methods, commenting, variables and all other work in:
CarPark.java
CarParkTests.java
CarTests.java
MotorCycleTests.java
Car.java
MotorCycle.java
Vehicle.java


Completion Status:
The program is incomplete and, as such, the GUI has not yet been implemented.

Additional Notes:
I, Shannon Levick, emailed Jim with concerns about working with Yujin for multiple reasons.
After attempting to work with him, I emailed Jim again, with no response.
I will submit these emails upon request.
The commencement of work on this assignment was put off as we wanted to meet in person to start off,
however Yujin could not come up with reasonable meetup times. Eventually I was forced to commence
work on it as less than a week was left. I feel the end result would be more complete had I had 
a more suitable partner in both available collaboration time and programming skill.

Yujin eventually asked me what he could contribute at 8:00pm on Tuesday 27th May, 2014.
